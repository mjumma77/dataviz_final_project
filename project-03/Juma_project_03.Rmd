# Data Visualization Project 03


In this exercise you will explore methods to create different types of data visualizations (such as plotting text data, or exploring the distributions of continuous variables).
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggridges)
```


## PART 1: Density Plots

Using the dataset obtained from FSU's [Florida Climate Center](https://climatecenter.fsu.edu/climate-data-access-tools/downloadable-data), for a station at Tampa International Airport (TPA) for 2022, attempt to recreate the charts shown below which were generated using data from 2016. You can read the 2022 dataset using the code below: 





```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

weather_tpa <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reisanar/datasets/master/tpa_weather_2022.csv")
# random sample 
sample_n(weather_tpa, 4)
```

See https://www.reisanar.com/slides/relationships-models#10 for a reminder on how to use this type of dataset with the `lubridate` package for dates and times (example included in the slides uses data from 2016).

### Data Preparation using Lubridate Package

I should note here that I used the lubridate package to convert the month from numbers to names.
A new variable is created and its called month.name
```{r}
tpa_clean <- weather_tpa %>%
  unite("doy", year, month, day, sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(
    doy = ymd(doy),
    month.name = month(doy,label = TRUE,abbr = FALSE),
    max_temp = as.double(max_temp),
    min_temp = as.double(min_temp),
    precipitation = as.double(precipitation
    ))
tpa_clean
```


Using the 2022 data: 

(a) Create a plot like the one below:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/reisanar/figs/raw/master/tpa_max_temps_facet.png")
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(tpa_clean, aes(x = max_temp, fill = month.name)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, color = "white", boundary = 1) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(month.name)) +
  labs(y= "Number of Days", x = "Maximum Tempratures") +
  theme_bw() +
  ylim(0,20) + 
  xlim(60,100)
```


Hint: the option `binwidth = 3` was used with the `geom_histogram()` function.

(b) Create a plot like the one below:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/reisanar/figs/raw/master/tpa_max_temps_density.png")
```
```{r}
ggplot(tpa_clean, aes(x = max_temp)) +
  geom_density(color = "black", fill = "grey50",
               bw = 0.5, kernel = "epanechnikov", size = 1) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Maximum Temprature")
```

Hint: check the `kernel` parameter of the `geom_density()` function, and use `bw = 0.5`.

(c) Create a plot like the one below:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/reisanar/figs/raw/master/tpa_max_temps_density_facet.png")
```

Hint: default options for `geom_density()` were used. 

```{r}
ggplot(tpa_clean, aes(x = max_temp, fill = month.name)) +
  geom_density() +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(month.name)) +
  labs(y= "Number of Days", x = "Maximum Temprature") +
  theme_bw()
```

(d) Generate a plot like the chart below:


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/reisanar/figs/raw/master/tpa_max_temps_ridges_plasma.png")
```
```{r}
ggplot(tpa_clean, aes(x = max_temp, y = fct_rev(month.name), fill = ..x..)) +
  geom_density_ridges_gradient(quantile_lines = TRUE, quantiles = 2, size = 1) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma", name = NULL) +
  labs(x = "Maximum Temprature (in Fehrenheit degrees)", y = NULL, color = "Temp")
```



Hint: use the`{ggridges}` package, and the `geom_density_ridges()` function paying close attention to the `quantile_lines` and `quantiles` parameters. The plot above uses the `plasma` option (color scale) for the _viridis_ palette.


(e) Create a plot of your choice that uses the attribute for precipitation _(values of -99.9 for temperature or -99.99 for precipitation represent missing data)_.
I will create a plot comparing precipitation between the coldest and the hottest months of the year. From the 
above chartswe can see that January is the coldest and August is the hottest.

```{r}
tpa_clean %>% 
  filter (month.name %in% c("August", "January")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = precipitation, x = format(doy, format = "%d"))) +
  geom_point(aes(color = ave_temp), alpha = 0.8, size = 3) +
  scale_colour_viridis_c(option = "inferno") +
  facet_wrap(vars(month.name)) +
  labs(title = "Comparing Perciptiation for the hottest and coldest month of the year",
       y= "Perciptiation",
       x = "Day") +
  theme_minimal()
```



## PART 2 

> **You can choose to work on either Option (A) or Option (B)**. Remove from this template the option you decided not to work on. 

### Option (B): Data on Concrete Strength 

Concrete is the most important material in **civil engineering**. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of _age_ and _ingredients_. The dataset used here is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), and it contains 1030 observations with 9 different attributes 9 (8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output variable). A data dictionary is included below: 


Variable                      |    Notes                
------------------------------|-------------------------------------------
Cement                        | kg in a $m^3$ mixture             
Blast Furnace Slag            | kg in a $m^3$ mixture  
Fly Ash                       | kg in a $m^3$ mixture             
Water                         | kg in a $m^3$ mixture              
Superplasticizer              | kg in a $m^3$ mixture
Coarse Aggregate              | kg in a $m^3$ mixture
Fine Aggregate                | kg in a $m^3$ mixture      
Age                           | in days                                             
Concrete compressive strength | MPa, megapascals


Below we read the `.csv` file using `readr::read_csv()` (the `readr` package is part of the `tidyverse`)

```{r}
concrete <- read_csv("../data/concrete.csv", col_types = cols())
```


Let us create a new attribute for visualization purposes, `strength_range`: 

```{r}
new_concrete <- concrete %>%
  mutate(strength_range = cut(Concrete_compressive_strength, 
                              breaks = quantile(Concrete_compressive_strength, 
                                                probs = seq(0, 1, 0.2))) )
```



1. Explore the distribution of 2 of the continuous variables available in the dataset. Do ranges make sense? Comment on your findings.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = new_concrete,
            mapping = aes(x = Concrete_compressive_strength))
p + geom_histogram()
```


```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = new_concrete,
            mapping = aes(x = Cement))
p + geom_histogram()
```


```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = new_concrete,
            mapping = aes(x = Age))
p + geom_histogram()
```

### Observations:
1. Data for the "Age" variable is extermely imbalanced.
2. "Concrete_compressive_strength" distribution is almost normal shaped.
3. I have examined other variables and they follow either category of the above  two.

2. Use a _temporal_ indicator such as the one available in the variable `Age` (measured in days). Generate a plot similar to the one shown below. Comment on your results.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/reisanar/figs/raw/master/concrete_strength.png")
```

```{r}
new_concrete %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = factor(Age),
                   y = Concrete_compressive_strength, fill = strength_range,)) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "Age (in days)",
       y= "Compressive Strength (in MPa)")
```



3. Create a scatterplot similar to the one shown below. Pay special attention to which variables are being mapped to specific aesthetics of the plot. Comment on your results. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/reisanar/figs/raw/master/cement_plot.png")
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = new_concrete,aes(x = Cement, y = Concrete_compressive_strength)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Water, size = Age), alpha = 0.6) + 
  scale_colour_viridis_c() +
  labs(title = "Exploring Strength vs (Cement, Age, and Water)",
       caption = "Age is measured in days",
       y= "Strength") +
  theme_minimal()
```
